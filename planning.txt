Here is a **clear, practical execution plan** — from now until the final video — so you know exactly what to do step-by-step. This avoids overthinking and ensures you don’t miss anything.

---

# ✅ **PHASE 1 — PREPARATION (Before Video Creation)**

### **1️⃣ Get missing approvals**

* Confirm (in writing) that the Director approves:

  * Use of his image
  * Use of his voice (if cloning)
  * Use of AI-generated video
* This is required for most platforms.

---

### **2️⃣ Collect necessary files**

* **Director’s full-body image** (already have)
* **Voice sample** (if cloning; 2–5 minutes clean audio)
* **Script** (must total ~220 seconds)

---

### **3️⃣ Finalize the script**

* 10s intro
* 10 labs × 20s each
* Include cues like:
  “Scene: Lab 3 background (AI-generated facility image)”
  — This makes later editing easier.

---

# ✅ **PHASE 2 — TOOL SELECTION (Choose the Platform)**

You need a platform that can:

* Animate a person from one image
* Clone voice (optional)
* Change background per segment
* Handle long videos (220 seconds)

### **Recommend best options:**

**Tier 1 (Strongest for your needs):**

* **HeyGen** (best for realistic lip-sync + long videos)
* **D-ID** (clean lipsync, strong movement control)
* **Pika Labs** (for background changes, but less accurate for faces)

**Tier 2 (If you need fine control):**

* **Runway Gen-2** (more flexible but less accurate face consistency)

**Best pick for your case:**
➡️ **HeyGen + Voice Clone + Scene Timeline Editing**

---

# ✅ **PHASE 3 — VIDEO PRODUCTION PIPELINE**

### **4️⃣ Create the AI voice**

If using real cloned voice:

* Upload Director’s audio sample
* Let tool generate voice ID
* Test and verify clarity
* If cloning is unavailable → use “Authoritative English Male Voice”

---

### **5️⃣ Build the video in segments (Best workflow)**

Produce **11 short clips**, then assemble.

Why?
Because 220 seconds in one AI generation → high risk of glitches.

**Segments to create:**

1. Intro (10 seconds)
   2–11. Labs 1–10 (20 seconds each)

---

### **6️⃣ For each segment, do this:**

* Upload Director’s body-shot image
* Paste the 20-second script for that lab
* Select:

  * Hyper-realistic style
  * Full-body framing
  * Realistic movement
  * Consistent lighting
  * No logos
  * Fade transition at start + end
* Choose AI-generated background → describe in prompt
  (“High-tech research facility representing Lab 4 mission, no logos”)

Generate the clip.

---

# ✅ **PHASE 4 — ASSEMBLY & CONSISTENCY**

### **7️⃣ Combine all 11 clips**

Use:

* CapCut
* Adobe Premiere
* DaVinci Resolve (free, pro-level)

Ensure:

* Seamless fade between every clip
* Same audio levels
* No sudden posture or lighting changes
* Background transitions flow naturally (fade recommended)

---

### **8️⃣ Quality Check**

Watch for:

* Lip-sync accuracy
* Background consistency
* Motion continuity
* No artifacting
* No frame jitters
* Director’s outfit unchanged
* Lighting consistency

If any segment is imperfect, regenerate only that segment.

---

# ✅ **PHASE 5 — FINALIZATION & DELIVERY**

### **9️⃣ Export final video**

Settings:

* 1080p
* 16:9
* MP4
* 20–40 Mbps bitrate (for clarity)

---

### **🔟 Save project files**

Keep:

* All clip exports
* Final edit project file
* Script
* AI voice asset
* Director consent note
  …in one folder for future edits.

---

# 🎯 **BONUS: OPTIONAL PROFESSIONAL TOUCHES**

* Add a title card (“Director’s Overview of 10 Labs”)
* Add a closing fade to black
* Add soft room-tone audio (optional but keeps video from feeling “dead silent”)
* Add consistent color correction (small amount)

---

# ✅ **If you want, I can create:**

✔ A step-by-step version customized for **HeyGen**, **D-ID**, or **Runway**
✔ A sample background description for each lab
✔ A checklist you can send to your team
✔ A script template

Just tell me what platform you plan to use **or** if you want me to help choose one.

3️⃣ How to Add Audio to WAN 2.2 Videos (Recommended Workflow)

Below is the officially recommended architecture when using WAN in ComfyUI.

Step 1 — Generate audio separately

Use any open-source Text-to-Speech or voice cloning model:

Recommended TTS Models
Model	Strength
OpenVoice	Best for cloning real speakers
MeloTTS	Very natural pacing + clarity
Bark	Good realism, fast
Tortoise TTS	Slow but high fidelity
VoiceCraft	Modern and flexible

Export audio as .wav or .mp3.

Step 2 — Generate video with WAN 2.2

In ComfyUI:

Run WAN 2.2 workflow

Output: silent_video.mp4

Each clip will be silent but visually complete.

Step 3 — (Optional) Improve lip-sync using GeneFace++ or Wav2Lip

If lip-sync accuracy matters:

Input: silent WAN video

Input: generated audio

Output: lips aligned to speech	

This step is optional but recommended for talking-head content.

Step 4 — Merge audio and video

Use DaVinci Resolve, CapCut, Premiere, or FFmpeg.

FFmpeg command:
ffmpeg -i silent_video.mp4 -i audio.wav -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental output_with_audio.mp4

Step 5 — Final assembly

If you have multiple WAN clips (e.g., 11 lab segments):

Import all into your editor

Sync each audio track

Add transitions (fade)

Export final video at 1080p

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great — Windows 11 + RTX 4070 Ti is **perfect** for running WAN 2.2, TTS models, GeneFace++, and ComfyUI smoothly.

Below is a **clean, installation-ready execution plan** specifically tailored for your hardware.
This includes:

* What to install
* How to configure WAN 2.2 in ComfyUI
* How to generate audio
* How to synchronize audio with WAN videos
* Optional automation inside ComfyUI

You can give this to your team as internal documentation.

---

# 📘 **Documentation: WAN 2.2 Audio Workflow Guide**

### Windows 11 · NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti

---

# 1️⃣ **System Requirements & Setup**

### **1.1 Hardware**

* **OS:** Windows 11
* **GPU:** RTX 4070 Ti (12 GB VRAM)
* **CPU:** Any modern i5/i7/Ryzen (not critical)
* **RAM:** 16 GB minimum (32 GB recommended)

4070 Ti benchmarks:

* WAN 2.2 → 10–20 sec video generation = 4–8 min
* TTS models = instantaneous to a few seconds
* GeneFace++ = real-time to 2× slower than real-time

---

# 2️⃣ **Install Required Software**

## **2.1 Install ComfyUI (Windows Portable Build)**

1. Download the latest **ComfyUI Windows portable build**:
   *(This works out of the box — no Python install needed.)*
2. Extract to:
   `C:\AI\ComfyUI`
3. Run:
   `run_nvidia_gpu.bat`

---

## **2.2 Install WAN 2.2 for ComfyUI**

You will do this:

```
C:\AI\ComfyUI\custom_nodes
```

Inside `custom_nodes`, clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/Wan-Video/WanComfyUI.git
```

Then download WAN 2.2 model files into:

```
C:\AI\ComfyUI\models\checkpoints
```

You need:

* `WAN_2.2.safetensors`
* Any supplementary motion/conditioning models (depending on the workflow)

Restart ComfyUI.

You should now see WAN workflows under the **Examples** tab.

---

# 3️⃣ **Why WAN 2.2 Outputs Silent Videos**

WAN 2.2:

* Has **no audio module**
* Was not trained on speech or sound
* Produces **only video frames**
* ComfyUI FFMPEG exporter builds a video stream **with no audio track**

This is normal and not configurable inside WAN.

---

# 4️⃣ **Audio Workflow (Required Step)**

You must generate audio **outside** WAN 2.2.
Your GPU is ideal for all major open-source voice models.

---

# 4.1 **Generate Audio (TTS / Voice Clone)**

Below are the recommended tools for Windows:

---

## **OPTION A — OpenVoice (Best for cloning the Director)**

1. Install Python 3.10
2. Clone repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice.git
   ```
3. Install requirements:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run:

   ```
   python inference.py --reference_audio director.wav --text "Your script here"
   ```

Produces:
`audio_director.wav`

**Pros:**
✔ Best cloning authenticity
✔ Controls tone and style

**Cons:**
Requires a clean voice sample (1–3 minutes).

---

## **OPTION B — MeloTTS (Best overall TTS voice quality)**

Install:

```
pip install meloaudio
```

Generate:

```python
from meloaudio import TTS
tts = TTS(language='EN')
tts.tts_to_file("This is the script text.", "output.wav")
```

**Pros:**
✔ Natural pacing
✔ Clear diction
✔ Great for corporate tone

---

## **OPTION C — Bark / Tortoise (extra options)**

Bark = more expressive, slightly robotic
Tortoise = slow but realistic

Both work flawlessly on 4070 Ti.

---

# 4.2 **(Optional but Recommended) Improve Lip-sync Accuracy**

### **Use GeneFace++**

Exceptional for identity + lip-sync:

GitHub: `https://github.com/yangxy/Genefacepp`

Pipeline:

1. Input video from WAN (`wan_video.mp4`)
2. Input audio (`audio.wav`)
3. Run:

   ```
   python inference.py --video wan_video.mp4 --audio audio.wav --output synced.mp4
   ```

**Result:**
WAN motion + corrected lips.

---

### **Alternative: Wav2Lip**

If GeneFace++ is too heavy:

```
python inference.py --face wan_video.mp4 --audio audio.wav --outfile lipsynced.mp4
```

---

# 5️⃣ **Merge Audio + Video (Final Step)**

## **Easiest method: CapCut Desktop**

1. Drag `wan_video.mp4`
2. Drag `audio.wav`
3. Align
4. Export at 1080p 16:9

---

## **Professional method: DaVinci Resolve**

1. Import video
2. Import audio
3. Offset by 1–3 frames if needed
4. Render

---

## **Command-line Method (FFmpeg)**

```bash
ffmpeg -i wan_video.mp4 -i audio.wav -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k final_video.mp4
```

---

# 6️⃣ **Optional: Fully Automated Workflow (Inside ComfyUI)**

This requires custom nodes:

### Install:

* **ComfyUI-FFmpeg Node**
* **ComfyUI-Audio Nodes** (community)
* **Wav2Lip Node** (optional)
* **Audio Combine Node**

Pipeline inside ComfyUI:

```
Text → TTS Node → Audio Output
          ↓  
Reference Image → WAN 2.2 → Video Output
          ↓
Lip-sync Node (optional)
          ↓
FFmpeg Node (merge audio + video)
```

Output:
**Final MP4 with audio automatically embedded**

This avoids external editing tools.

---

# 7️⃣ **Recommended Workflow For Your Use Case (Director + Labs)**

### For each lab clip (20 seconds):

1. Generate **audio** with OpenVoice / MeloTTS
2. Run **WAN 2.2** (video only)
3. (Optional) Run **GeneFace++** for accurate lip-sync
4. Add audio to video via FFmpeg/Resolve
5. Export clip
6. Use the **last frame as reference image** for the next clip (identity consistency trick)

After generating all 11 clips:

* Combine them
* Add fade transitions
* Export final 1080p 16:9
* Done

Your 4070 Ti will handle this pipeline efficiently.

---

# 🎯 **FINAL RESULT**

After this setup, you will have a **fully open-source**, subscription-free workflow:

### WAN 2.2

↓ (video only)

### OpenVoice / MeloTTS

↓ (audio)

### GeneFace++

↓ (sync)

### FFmpeg / Resolve

↓
🎬 **Final talking, moving director video with audio**

---

# If you want, I can also provide:

✔ A ComfyUI workflow JSON for WAN 2.2 + lip-sync
✔ Exact WAN settings for identity consistency
✔ A ready-made batch-generation script for all 11 clips
✔ Background prompt templates for each lab segment

Just tell me **if you want a generator-ready workflow or documentation PDF version.**
